### This project is a fork of [Flowtime.js](https://github.com/marcolago/flowtime.js).

Flowtime.js is a very impressive framework for building HTML-based presentations. I forked this project for making some changes:
- add a title bar to show previous & next page title and link (actually this is from the original documentation, but the capability is not shown by default)
- add progress indicator of the current slide in the middle of the title bar (e.g. 3/20)
- add [zoom.js](https://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js/) capability. The page can be zoomed in/out by pressing ALT and click anywhere.
### Flowtime.js is a framework for easily building HTML presentations or websites.

For all other questions, please check the very useful [original documentation](https://github.com/marcolago/flowtime.js/blob/master/README.md).
